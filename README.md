# Introduction

This project contains code to process images using the Indro Robotics Ranger Mini received by the TBS Group at the University of Alberta. It aims to integrate AI image recognition to find a target to navigate to in the robot's environment using a simple text prompt. This collection of packages contains a simple control demo, however the end goal is to use this in coordination with the [Navigation2](https://docs.nav2.org/) software stack. For more information, see each package's README.

# Introduction

This project aims to integrate image processing into the Telerobotic and Biorobotic Systems Group's Wheeled Mobile Manipulator (WMM) system. It does this through a variety of ROS packages which can be seen above. For more information about each package, see their respective README files.

For setup information for the WMM, see the wmm_control package.
